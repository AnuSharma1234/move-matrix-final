MoveMatrix: Composable DeFi Primitive Generator - Implementation Plan
I'll help you create a detailed implementation plan for MoveMatrix, focusing on how to leverage Move's resource model to build composable DeFi primitives that can be combined into complex financial products.
Problem Statement Breakdown
MoveMatrix aims to solve several key challenges in the DeFi ecosystem:

Fragmentation: Current DeFi protocols often operate in isolation with incompatible standards.
Security vulnerabilities: Custom smart contract development introduces risks.
Technical barriers: Complex DeFi compositions require significant technical expertise.
Lack of standardization: No universal building blocks that can be safely composed.

Core Concept
Build a platform that provides:

Pre-audited, standardized DeFi primitives written in Move
A composition framework to connect these primitives
Visual tools for non-technical users to build financial products
Testing infrastructure to ensure security


MVP Implementation Plan
Phase 1: Core Primitives Development
Let's implement two fundamental DeFi primitives to start:

Lending/Borrowing Primitive

Simple overcollateralized loans
Configurable interest rate models
Liquidation mechanisms


Swap Primitive

Constant product AMM (similar to Uniswap v2)
Fee mechanism
Price oracle integration


Example Complex Financial Products
For the MVP, implement two example compositions:

Leveraged Yield Farming

Composition steps:

Deposit collateral into lending pool
Borrow tokens against the collateral
Add liquidity to a swap pool using borrowed tokens
Claim rewards periodically
Swap rewards for borrowed token and partially repay loan




Collateralized Debt Position with Automatic Liquidation Protection

Composition steps:

Create CDP by depositing collateral and borrowing stable tokens
Set up monitoring for collateral ratio
If ratio approaches liquidation threshold:
a. Swap some collateral for stable tokens
b. Repay portion of debt to increase collateral ratio
c. Notify user


Phase 4: Visual Composition Tool
Create a simple web-based UI for non-technical users:

Frontend Components

Primitive selection panel
Visual graph builder (nodes and connections)
Parameter configuration forms
Simulation/testing panel


Backend API

Endpoint to fetch available primitives
Endpoint to save compositions
Endpoint to execute compositions
Endpoint to validate compositions


The MVP will focus on:

Two core DeFi primitives (lending/borrowing and swapping)
A composition framework for connecting primitives
Two example complex products (leveraged yield farming and CDP with protection)
A visual builder interface for non-technical users
Basic testing and security infrastructure
